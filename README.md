# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify plant diseases from leaf images. Early and accurate detection is essential for boosting agricultural productivity and sustainability. The trained model leverages image data to recognize various plant diseases, enabling timely and informed decision-making for farmers and agronomists.

## 📌 Introduction
Plant diseases severely affect agricultural yield. Traditional detection involves manual inspection, which can be slow and error-prone. This project aims to **automate disease detection** using a CNN that classifies images of plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories.

---

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset consists of healthy and diseased plant leaf images, with multiple classes corresponding to specific diseases.
